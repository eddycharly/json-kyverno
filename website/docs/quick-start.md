# Quick start

In this example we will create a YAML payload and policy and use `kyverno-json` to run analysis.

## Create a YAML payload

For this example we will use a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) `Pod` payload.

Create a `payload.yaml` file and paste the content below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pods-simple-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - command:
        - sleep
        - "3600"
      image: busybox:latest
      name: pods-simple-container
```

This is a simple `Pod` with one container running the `busybox` latest docker image.

Now, using the `latest` tag of an image is considered a bad practice.

In the next part of this example we will write a policy to detect such cases.

## Create a policy to block `latest` images

Create a `policy.yaml` file and paste the content below:

```yaml
apiVersion: json.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: pod-policy
spec:
  rules:
    - name: no-latest
      # Match payloads corresponding to pods
      match:
        any:
        - apiVersion: v1
          kind: Pod
      validate:
        message: Pod `{{ metadata.nameÂ }}` uses an image with tag `latest`
        assert:
          all:
          - spec:
              # Iterate over pod containers
              # Note the `~.` modifier, it means we want to iterate over array elements in descendants
              ~.containers:
                image:
                  # Check that an image tag is present
                  (contains(@, ':')): true
                  # Check that the image tag is not `:latest`
                  (ends_with(@, ':latest')): false
```

This policy iterates over pod containers, checking that the container image has a tag specified and that the tag being used is not `latest`.

## Run `kyverno-json` scan

With the payload and policy above, we can invoke `kyverno-json` with the command below:

```bash
kyverno-json scan --payload payload.yaml --policy policy.yaml
